# API

- Application Programming Interface that allows applications to communicate with each other.
  
- It is a messenger that delivers your request to the provider and delivers the response back to you.
  
- A code written by someone else who's giving you permission through API key to use that code
  
- Eg 
  - Singup/Signin Using Google API
  - Zomato/Swiggy using Google Maps API
